    <title>My Journey</title>
    <body>
        <p>I first started out with coding freshman year in College. I started as a engineer at Mizzou.<br>
        I took an intro Computer Science class, I enjoyed the class even though it was a little difficult.<br>
        But as an engineer that was the only part I had to take in it. I focused on my other studies once I completeled the class. <br>
        I wasn't getting the grades I wanted to I had to make a hard decision and I chose a different major. <br></p>

        <p>I worked at a bar and I enjoyed that so I thought I would do down that path and I went with Hospitality Management.<br>
        I learned to cook and manage a restaurant and people through that program. I have been doing that for the past 3 years.<br>
        I enjoyed it in the beginning, but now I am realizing it is a lifestyle that I don't want to live anymore.<br></P>

        <P>I was going to go back to school for Computer science, since I enjoyed doing it school.<br>
        I also enjoy working with technology. Right now I am also building a desktop to help with LaunchCode and for my free time.<br>
        I was planning on going to UMSL, I was accepted and everything, then someone told me about LaunchCode.<br>
        It sounded great and it was free so even better! I applied and waited for the response.<br>
        I finally heard back that I was accepted and I was over joyed that all my hard work had paid off.<br>
        Now I have been trying to work hard between and full time job and LaunchCode, but I enjoy it.<br>
